## **Project Overview**
This project dives into India's GDP data from **1960 to 2022** using **statistical correlation techniques** to explore relationships between the GDP levels and the year-over-year GDP growth rate. By applying **Pearsonâ€™s correlation**, we aim to uncover key economic insights, analyze trends, and visualize India's economic growth over time.

Whether you're a student of economics or someone interested in understanding how GDP trends reflect growth patterns, this project provides a deep dive into statistical techniques and data visualization.

### **Key Highlights**:
- ðŸ“ˆ **GDP Trend Analysis**: Visualizing GDP from 1960 to 2022 to identify periods of economic growth and stagnation.
- ðŸ“‰ **Year-over-Year GDP Growth Rate**: Calculating how India's GDP changes year by year.
- ðŸ”— **Correlation Analysis**: Using Pearsonâ€™s correlation to quantify the relationship between GDP levels and growth rates.
- ðŸ“Š **Data Visualizations**: Creating insightful plots using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
